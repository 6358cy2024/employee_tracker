# employee_tracker
The purpose of this assignment was to complete the Javascript of this webpage that allows the user to enter input data of employees as an object that included 2 strings of the first and last names, and the salary.

This project was built to further my understanding on how JS elements interact with the format of a webpage and html elements.
I was able to develop functions that can store information users input as well as getting a random value and letting the system call a specific object.

It solves the problem of an incomplete website with missing JS functions. The button on the center of the page didn't do anything otherwise.

I learned how to rewrite an interactive page. Learned how to fit Objects into an array that stores them all and can display them all on the console log. 
I also learned how to create a random number function that I can use to get a random element from the array.

This project stands out because it is my first attempt on using JS elements into a website that has other html and CSS elements. Before I just used JS by itself and created simple loops and functions and didn't use too much with objects and classes.
